# Wiki

Wiki pages are stored in Markdown format, where:
- other wiki pages are referred to in the format `convind://<data-id>?revision=<revision-id>` where the revision field is optional, and
- the datatype of all data revisions must start with `text/markdown`.

Markdown format here means CommonMark with (potentially) a few extensions, such as:
- the strikethrough extension, and
- the autolinks extension.

## TODO

- link auto-completion
- backlinks
- 2-hop links
- list of all pages
