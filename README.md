# Convergent Inclusive Data

Convergent Inclusive Data is a set of tools (?) to help:
- store arbitrary data in an inclusive format, and
- facilitate queries on said data to produce convergent properties of said data.

To complement the above goals, it also should
- not require Internet connectivity
- run on a wide variety (loosely defined) of machines
